I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeq from between the whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall, from the inceessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jammping jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made uopn them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass--the rabid creates swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.

#### 1. So Strongly and Metaphyusically did I Concede

In the tumultuos business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is muc running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and thee same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little.

#### 2. So Strongly and Metaphyusically did I Concede

The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, exepcting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer floudner about, half on the whale and half in th water, as the vast mass revloves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeq figured in the Highland costume--ashirt and socks--inwhich to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
